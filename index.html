          <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <div>
          <p>My name is Tara George Samperio and although I was born in small-town Ohio, I consider myself to be a global citizen. Growing up, I had a curiosity for learning and a love for storytelling. This led me to study Journalism & American Studies as an undergraduate student and since then has inspired me to pursue a master's degree in Media Management at the University of Miami.</p>

          <p>The first time I traveled abroad on my own changed my future more than I could have ever imagined. In just two months, I explored new countries and tried new things; but mostly, I developed a passion for learning about new cultures and identities, including my own. After this intitial experience, I returned to Spain and lived in Madrid for eight years, until I moved to Paris, France, where I lived for nearly two years.</p>

          <p>During my time in Europe, I taught English as a second language. I developed many new skills; from how to communicate across cultures to how to make the perfect tortilla Espa√±ola. I became bilingual in Spanish, something I never imagined possible when sitting in my high school Spanish class in rural Ohio. I also gained an understanding of my future career goals. So when I returned to the U.S., I sought out opportunities in international education, eager to help others bridge divides through an appreciation of cultures, languages, policies, and perspectives.</p>

          <p>Through this work, I am able to merge my excitement for media and storytelling with my dedication to global education and learning.</p>
